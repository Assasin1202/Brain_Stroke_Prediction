# Brain Stroke Prediction - PRML Major Project

## Project Overview:

This major project, undertaken as part of the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML) course, focuses on predicting brain strokes using advanced machine learning techniques.
Our primary objective is to develop a robust predictive model for identifying potential brain stroke occurrences, a critical task with far-reaching implications in the field of healthcare.

## Project Highlights:

üìä Thorough Data Analysis and Visualization: We begin our journey with a deep dive into data analysis and visualization. This phase involves understanding the dataset, uncovering hidden patterns, and gaining insights into the factors contributing to brain strokes.

üîß Optimized Preprocessing Techniques: To ensure the highest model performance, we employ advanced data preprocessing techniques. This step involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization to prepare the dataset for modeling.

‚öôÔ∏è Diverse Range of Machine Learning Algorithms: We explore a wide array of machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and more. Each algorithm brings its unique strengths to the table.

üìä Model Comparison and Evaluation Metrics: A critical aspect of our project is the comparative analysis of these algorithms. We evaluate their performance using a suite of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to determine the optimal model.

üìù Comprehensive Report: Our project culminates in a detailed report that provides comprehensive insights, methodologies, and conclusions. The report not only highlights the best-performing model but also delves into the nuances of brain stroke prediction.

üå°Ô∏è Healthcare Impact: We recognize the significance of accurate brain stroke prediction in the realm of healthcare analytics. By contributing to the development of effective predictive models, we aim to make a positive impact on healthcare outcomes and patient well-being.
